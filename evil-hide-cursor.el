;;; Commentary:

;; While using evil-mode, if set cursor-type to nil to make the cursor
;; disappear, the cursor is redisplayed.

;; This mode was created to suppress this feature.

;;; Code:

;; (define-minor-mode evil-hide-cursor-mode
;;   "the cursor hiding in evil buffer" nil "" nil
;;   (unless (local-variable-p 'evil-refresh-cursor)
;;     (make-local-variable 'evil-refresh-cursor))
;;   (if evil-hide-cursor-mode
;;       (setq evil-refresh-cursor nil
;;	    cursor-type nil)
;;     (setq evil-refresh-cursor t)
;;     (evil-refresh-cursor)))
